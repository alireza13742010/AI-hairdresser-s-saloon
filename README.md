#  Model Decription 
This is the repository for chnaging the colors on hair and lips for women and men.

The code is developed based on the combining the ResNet18 with attention mechanism and dense layers for feature extraction.

The final feed forward model segmentation part is composed of 2 convolutional layers with one dense layer with sigmoid activation function.

#  How to run 
#- Ask for the weight and then put the saved weights to your home repository. 

#- Place the model.py and resnet.py in the same repository.

#- Run the main hair_and_lips_color_chnages.ipynb.
